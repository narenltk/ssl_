## Step 1:

Open your terminal and git clone with the following command

```

## Step 2:

Since I have given all the dependencies in the package.json all you need to do is give the following command

```
npm install
```
This command actually installs all the dependencies given in the package.json file.

## Step 3: 

You need to create a folder named cert and follow the steps in creating the SSL certificate as given in the blog

## Step 4:

Once your done with all the steps given above all you to do is just fire up the server, with the following command and check your local host

checkout "https://localhost:3030"

I have used the port 3030 and you can change the port to any number you like.
